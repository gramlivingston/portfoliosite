Field Interactions is an installation that is set in a clearing deep in a re-nativized prairie wetland of Chicago. The LCD screen glows a cool
white and the image is only constituted when it is polarized by the reflections in nearby puddles. In the pools of water viewers can see a live
video feed from the NOAA Satellite showing city lights at night.
Field Interactions is part of an inquiry into framing situations that resolve the contradiction in real-time image culture that proposes that
the tools for servicing the cult of speed are incompatible with being located at the environment where you are. Under what conditions can
an electronic image mediate both a transference over distance, and a sense of placement within an immediate environment. This piece
recognizes a spatial relationship by separating the source of the image and the image.
